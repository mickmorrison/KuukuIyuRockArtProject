"General","Specific","Description"
"Human","-","Human form, sex indeterminate."
"Human","Male","Identifiable by genitalia."
"Human","Horizontal orientation","Horizontal positioning, possibly indicating death"
"Anthropomorph","-","Humanoid shape with exaggerated features, including those reminiscent of animals."
"Animal","-","Indicated by similarity to known taxa"
"Animal","Canine","Four legged, pronounced ears and tail."
"Animal",NA,NA
"Animal","Freshwater tortoise","Rounded body with four limbs with claws. Head and neck indicated with head slightly tapered at end."
"Animal",NA,NA
"Animal","Lizard","Identified by short legs, birds-eye view representation and long, thick tails."
"Animal","Macropod","Rounded body, distinct ears and elongate face, tapered tail and distinctly shorter forelimbs than rear limbs. Paws indicated."
"Animal","Marine turtle","Four similarly-shaped appendages on ovate or rounded body. Rounded, short head, often with eyes. Several distinct body shapes noted, potentially indicating species differentiation."
"Animal","Stingray","Broad diamond-shaped body with thin, elongate tail. Body features spots."
"Animal","Contact","Unambiguously post-contact features, including lettering or material culture."
"Zoomorph","-","Motif with distinctly animalistic features, but not self-evidently depicting a known taxon.  e.g. presence of claws, tail."
"Tracks","-","Singular or series of marks that resemble known animal tracks."
"Tracks","Bird Tracks","A ‘trident shaped’ motif comprising a central line with two adjacent lines, converging at a central point. Singular, pairs or series of similar tracks evident.  At times, a dot or pit at the convergence point, with a more elongated central line. The lines may also be curved and/or joined end to end or back to back."

"Geometric","Complex circle","Circle outline, sometimes with added internal detail such as repeating dots, bisecting lines, concentric circles, and spirals (after Franklin 2004:190)."
"Geometric","Complex geometric","Motifs with multiple geometric features including complex lines and dot clusters that appear to be a homogenous composition or close association (after Morwood 1979:272)"
"Geometric","Complex lines","Groupings of lines that may intersect in various ways, including Morwood’s ‘rake,’ grid, tree and ladder groups (1979: Table 7:3). Differentiated from mazes as being simpler, and from radiating lines/stars by their lack of central meeting point and radiating nature. Follows most closely Franklin’s (2004:190) complex lines definition."
"Geometric","Crescent","Crescents may be simple or complex with internal fill such as vertical lines, or appendages (Franklin 2004:190). Crescents may also be nested in groups."
"Geometric","Dots","Refers to the use of repetitive, infilled circular pigment shapes. May be in a vertical/horizontal series or even clusters."
"Geometric","Single circle","A singular pigment circle with no detail or (but may be outline or solid)."
"Geometric","Line","A singular line that is not clearly associated with others. Includes all orientations and lengths, including those with undulating form following surface features, such as ridges."
"Geometric","Line series","Assemblages of lines, vertical or horizontal, and placed parallel or almost parallel to each other.. Includes stacked horizontal or vertical groups."
"Geometric","Pit","Refers to generally circular petroglyph shapes, sometimes referred to as cupules. Can be singular, in a cluster or vertical/horizontal series."
"Geometric","Radiating lines","Following Rosenfeld (1981:54), these comprise “patterns of lines or bands which converge on to a broadly defined point or zone; they are generally rather asymmetrical”. This includes those that are made up of curving lines, and those that have obvious variation in the length of the lines (see also Franklin 2004:190)."
"Geometric","Star","Stars are defined after Rosenfeld (1981:54) as ‘radiating designs in which the rays are of approximately equal lengths and converge to a point; stars are not necessarily symmetrical."
"Geometric","Tool sharpening","Likely a result of a repetitive rubbing or engraving action to sharpen a tool, rather than a deliberate creation of a motif."
