# Introduction

Stylistic variability in this rock art is frequently theorised to reflect the degree of social interaction between distinct social groups in the past [@david2002; @david1990; @mcdonald2010; @rosenfeld1981; @ross2013). It is widely argued that art frequently formed part of past social strategies to visually communicate group identity in relation social networks tending towards being more open, and regionally extensive, or closed and locally oriented [@david1998; @haberle2004; @mcdonald2008; @mcdonald2010; @ross2013]. Cape York Peninsula is a key context where these ideas have been developed, with both past and ongoing work focused on a range of localities in the south, south west and far north (Figure 1). Across and within these study areas, distinct trends have been suggested towards high heterogeneity in motifs within local and sub-regional contexts, for instance as documented within the Laura Basin as well as the Torres Strait Island and northern Peninsula area [@cole2012; @david1990]. By contrast, across the ranges of south western CYP, a more homogenous tradition exists at regional scale, with greater use of geometric, non-figurative and abstract designs. Indeed, this broad catchment is often seen as the division between two major regional rock art provinces, with increasingly localised motif variabilty to the north east of this region and into CYP itself, and regional homogeneity to the south and west [@david2002].

Within this wider study area, the CYP mainland north of Coen (Figure 1) has seen little relatively limited published archaeological work [@tutchener2019]. Extensive ranges to the north of Laura have exploring Indigenous colonial histories [see @tutchener2018; @morrison2019], but knowledge of the basic character of the pre-colonial, deep-time archaeological record here, including rock art, remains poorly developed. This paper reports on work conducted with and for the Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation (CAC), who manages a large Indigenous Protected Area on behalf of Kuuku I'yu Pama (Northern Kaanju people). This study emerged from concerns regarding the management of rock art sites within and near to Kuuku I"yu Ngaachi. Our research aimed to identify and record rock art sites and obtain baseline digital datasets of their current fabric, to explore local trends in the distribution and form as a basis for exploring what these assemblages potentially reveal about histories of social interaction and place marking within the study area.

In doing so, we have embraced reproducibility as a goal of our work, in order to move beyond 'point and click' analysis workflows which obscure many decisions made by researchers. As @marwick2017 [425] states:

> The typical contemporary journal article describing the results of an archaeological study rarely contains enough information for another archaeologist to reproduce its statistical results and figures. Raw data are rarely openly and fully provided, perhaps due to the absence of data-sharing standards that acknowledge the sensitive nature of much of our data. Similarly, many of the decisions made in cleaning, tidying, analyzing, and visualizing the data are unrecorded and unreported.

Possible more here on problems of reproducibiilty in RAR.

This paper first explores prior archaeological and rock art research in CYP. Following that, we present out methodology for a reproducible formal analysis, describe the assemblages and our results. Analytical insights are drawn and explored in relation to the wider question of social interaction in CYP, though recognising the distinct need for far more work in the northern Cape York Peninsula region.

# Rock art of Cape York Peninsula

The rock art of Cape York Peninsula is well known as a result of decades of work, particularly in what has become known as the Quinkan rock art province, across Laura in the south east [@cole1995; @cole2011; @cole2016 @morwood1995], (Figure 1). Here, a 'vast assemblage of Aboriginal rock art' [@cole2016, 61] has been subject to intensive studies since the 1960s revealing a deep-time record of figurative painted motifs, often highly varied across catchments [@cole1995; @cole2016; @david1995; @flood1987; @rosenfeld1981; @rosenfeld1982; @trezise1971]. Cole (1995:56) described these motifs as 'typical of the Australian Figurative Style' while noting that the 'simple figurative' designation 'does not do justice to the complexities and variations in motif and form' in Quinkan Art [@cole1995, 56]. Other examples of locally or regionally dominant motifs, colours or styles are well known regionally (Figure 1) [@cole1995; @cole2016; @cole2024; @cole2010; @david1995; @walsh1984]. Further west, research across the upper Mitchell and Palmer River catchments (Figure 1) has documented a distinctive pattern of predominantly non-figurative motifs [@david1995; @david1998; @david1996]. Together, these regions evidence a broad trend of increased preference for figurative painted motifs northeast of the Mitchell River, with stencils, engraved tracks or geometric motifs more common to the southwest [@cole1995; @david1995; @david1990] (Figure 1).

![Figure 1: Cape York Peninsula showing localities mentioned in text](images/Figure01_CYP_TSI_StudyArea.png){width="15cm"}

Excavations at rock shelter and many rock art sites across both southeast CYP and the TSI contexts have helped to place rock art into a broader regional chronology. For the southeast CYP, there are firm minimum estimates for a human presence across multiple sites at ca. 35,000--30,000 BP, with some suggesting more fleeting occupation as early as ca 50,000 BP [@david1995; @david1998; @david2007; @morwood1995; @rosenfeld1981. Together with other archaeological evidence, rock art datasets broadly reflect diachronic changes in regional symbolic networks through time, with early art assemblages argued to be comprised of 'very similar sets of abstract images, of limited range' particularly engravings of geometric or track designs, over a vast area [@david1998, 211]. The late Holocene, however, saw 'the emergence of regionally-specific networks of interaction and symbolic frameworks' (David and Lourandos 1998:211). These purported long-term changes coincide with wider archaeological evidence argued to support larger populations and more intensive use of landscapes regionally through the mid- to late Holocene [@haberle2004].

Work on the islands to the north of CYP, within the southern Torres Strait, is also highly relevant. Historical and ethnographic work highlights both distinctive and shared cultural traditions. Investigations of rock art and other media, as well as archaeological excavations, provide important comparative data on regional occupation and spatial patterns [@brady2008; @brady2010; @brady2007]. Rock art studies have comprised analysis of some 983 determinate images from ten sites, with shared figurative imagery evidenced in varied ways across the TSI and on Cape York itself (Figure 1). For the Cape York and southernmost TSI islands, Brady found that despite extensive evidence for diverse social and economic exchanges between people, they generally lacked shared imagery. This, he suggested, reflected a 'cultural divide between horticulturalists and hunter-gatherers' [@brady2008, 247]. Notably, like south-east CYP, these studies demonstrate that archaeological evidence provides a critical framework for interpreting regional art assemblages. Excavations indicate fleeting visitation prior to 3500-3800 BP [@david2004; @mcniven2006; @mcniven2008] and subsequent population increases similar to those argued to have occurred across south-east CYP. A widespread TSI cultural horizon is evident in occupation sequences after \~2600 BP, and signals broad regional cultural changes [@mcniven2006]. McNiven and colleagues [-@mcniven2006, 49] describe this phase as comprising widespread evidence of 'Papuan maritime, horticultural and pottery-making peoples', resulting in a Papuan linguistic and cultural overlay over those pre-existing and probably Australian Aboriginal populations of the TSI [-@mcniven2006,49]. Hence, shared graphic systems reflected in rock art motifs across the TSI broadly correlate with historical socio-cultural interaction spheres at multiple levels [@brady2010], further highlighting the value of this approach.

Prior studies of rock art in CYP and TSI have tended to be undertaken in close association with First Nations Peoples and thus often incorporate contemporary and historical Indigenous Knowledge, as well as that represented in ethnological, ethnographic or other ethnohistorical accounts [@brady2008; @brady2010; @cole2010 @cole2011; @david2002; @david1995; @david1998; @david1999; @morwood1995]. This is vitally important in relation to CYP where rock art motifs have been demonstrated to skew towards being late-Holocene or younger in age (Cole et al. 1995). Furthermore, unlike European contexts, rock art in CYP is part of a living tradition of people being connected to particular landscape areas, such as clan estate or language areas, and with ongoing dynamic knowledge systems [@cole2016]. Central here are links between notions of social identity and the kinds of motifs people created; indeed, a general view expressed in many Australian studies is that rock art is broadly reflective of cultural or social identity and cohesion -- though this can be highly contextual [@brady2014; @david1995; @cole2016; @mcdonald2008; @ross2013; @tacon1994; @tacon1996]. This work amply highlights the cultural salience of the concepts of Country and clan, demonstrating that these core concepts continue to underpin contemporary and recent historical relationships with landscape. It also highlights the very clear value of investigating links between rock art and 'clan countries, language boundaries, \[and\] social networks' [@cole2016, 64]. This, we argue, further highlights the central need for exploration of these issues for Kuuku I'yu (Northern Kaanju) Pama and Country, reiterated through our collaboration with the Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation.

# Study area

The study area is located within the northern-most portion of the Great Dividing Range, within the *Ngaachi* (Country, place) of Kuuku I'yu (Northern Kaanju) Pama (CYP Aboriginal People). . These homelands are \~200-400 m in elevation with substantial escarpments, plateaus, hills, and some mountains interspersed with extensive sandplains and a mosaic of watercourses and inland wetlands (Figure 2) [@claudie2007, 92]. The region is also described as the Paayanmu (Rainbow Serpent) cultural landscape today, after a major Story and Ancestral Being, Paayanmu [@claudie2007; @smith2003]. Stories are cultural creation narratives of high cultural salience to Pama, and provide a deep ontological basis for understanding and being in the world.

Today, Kuuku I'yu Pama and communities hailing from and with connections to their *Ngaachi* across the northern great dividing ranges reside in regional towns, cities and communities across northern CYP, Cairns and beyond (Figure 1). This reflects the history of settler-colonial expropriation of land in the region and active moves to kill, subdue, or forcibly relocate Pama into missions and reserves, which occurred from the 1870s through until the 1940s, and initially focused on the central portion of the Peninsula [@hafner1999; @morrison2019; @smith2016; @tutchener2019]. This was linked to the late nineteenth century northward expansion into CYP by pastoralists and miners and supported by local units of the Queensland Colonial Government's Native Mounted Police force who routinely attacked and killed Pama throughout the study area and beyond [@loos1982; @Morrison2019; @Tutchener2019). These activities displaced surviving Pama to missions or reserves or near European settlements such as Coen [@smith2016] (Figure 1). Chase [-@chase1980, 67-8] highlighted one effect of this at the Lockhart River community in the 1970s (Figure 1), noting that the local community had transitioned from:

> ... belonging to an expanded social network of interconnection with others occupying the northern Peninsula, to their present position of a small and discrete social unit bounded by extreme social and geographic isolation. The social matrix has been contracted into a small universe by the process of European domination.

Despite these shifts, Kuuku I'yu and other Kaanju Pama continued to live or work in their Homelands or were able to visit—often through pastoral and mining pursuits @claudie2007; @hafner1999; @smith2000; @smith2016; @tutchener2018. From the 1970s, Pama began returning to re-occupy important places, founding what has become the community of 'Chuulangun' during the 1990s [@chuulangunaboriginalcorporation2023; @claudie2007; @smith2016] (Figure 2), and since then, have initiated a range of research and conservation projects [@chuulangunaboriginalcorporation2003; @chuulangunaboriginalcorporation2011; @claudie2007; @claudie2012]. Our collaborative research emerged within the wider Chuulangun-led land management work, as a heritage management study of known rock art sites (Morrison 2015). This work expanded to a regional study of Kuuku I'yu history and heritage [@dearden2021; @fairhead2020; @marshall2018; @tutchener2018; @tutchener2019], undertaken through the auspisces of the Australian Research Council Linkage project 'Sugarbag and Shellfish: Indigenous Foodways in Colonial CYP', with a central focus on examining Indigenous foodways as a window into the histories of Pama throughout central and western CYP, particularly in the colonial period.

The geology of Kuuku I'yu *Ngaachi* is diverse, with a range of metamorphic, sedimentary and igneous rock formations and related land units (Morton 1924) (Figure 2). Our specific focus here, and in research with Kuuku I'yu Pama to date, has been the Gilbert River Formation, which comprises low ranges of clayey quartzose sandstone with granular and pebble conglomerate throughout (Geoscience Australia 2023; Smart et al. 1972) (Figure 2). This is also the same geological unit on which a considerable proportion of art within the Laura Lowlands occurs (see Cole 1995) (Figure 1). These sandstone escarpments predominantly occur across the western portions of Kuuku I'yu homelands, with intervening low rises and plains of sandy, detrital and other unconsolidated sediments and a mosaic of watercourses and wetland systems (Figure 2).

Vegetation regionally is predominantly dry savannah woodland on more elevated and well-drained sandy soils, while lower-lying substrates tend to support wetlands, rainforests and notophyll or mesophyll vine forests (Nelder et al. 2023). Like other parts of the Australian tropics, major seasonal shifts in vegetation and surface water are associated with the onset of the summer monsoon, with annual rainfall at a local weather station averaging 1597 mm annually (Australian Bureau of Meteorology 2024). This recharges waterways and streams, floods low-lying landforms and promotes considerable vegetation growth transforming the landscape through the summer months. This is followed by an extended annual 'dry season' characterised by the progressive decline in rainfall from April and, from September, increasing temperatures, drier conditions, and frequent grass fires. Pama classify seasonal changes in weather and associated ecological shifts into at least 5-7 periods, reflecting deep biocultural knowledge and understanding of landscape ecology (Bassani et al. 2006; Chase 1980; Claudie 2003; Chase and Sutton 1981; Mackey and Claudie 2015).

# Methodology

The late Elder, CEO of the Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation (CAC), and co-author David Claudie initiated this project and invited Morrison to investigate rock art sites to inform ongoing land and heritage management programs [@morrison2015]. Five days of fieldwork were conducted in mid-December 2014 with rangers from the Chuulangan Aboriginal Corporation (CAC). The relatively brief time at each site available for detailed motif analysis was overcome by developing a fully digital recording methodology based on the then-emerging technology of digital photogrammetry. This method was selected because it was theoretically able to be deployed quickly in the field, with captured data used to produce interactive, high-resolution photorealistic 3-D models of motifs, panels and overall sites in their original context. The CAC considered this a worthwhile approach as it did not require physical interference with the art and could provide detailed baseline photographic and geomatic data to aid future research and management, as well as enabling Elders to view modelled sites remotely.

The photogrammetry technique 'Structure from Motion' was explored initially, and was somewhat experimental approach in 2014. It is now very common in archaeology [@jalandoni2018; @peña-villasenín2019] and this project sought to evaluate its value for rapid digital rock art documentation using basic field equipment. Our rationale was to use several fixed prime lenses to photograph each panel systematically, with 60-80% overlap on individual images, and working across all panels and intervening surfaces at each site. Images were subject to lens and colour correction and then processed with Agisoft Photoscan 1.4 (AgiSoft LLC 2012) (now Agisoft Metashape). Methods comprised first processing batches of wide-angle imagery to create overarching models of each site or part thereof as a whole ahead of photography with a fixed prime lens to collect higher-resolution imagery for each panel. This process produced multiple independent models, which were then merged and geo-rectified.

Alignment of the models to real-world coordinates were not necessary for our analysis, but important for alignment to other datasets. Physical datums were observed and recorded at each study site. Coordinates in 3-D space were obtained for prominent points at each site using a total station set to take reflectorless measurements from the local datum. Models were subsequently exported to orthomosaics; these, along with original photography and the interactive 3-D models were all used in desktop motif analysis.

Digital enhancement is widely used in rock art research and many innovations in earlier methodologies. DStretch©, a plugin for the ImageJ software developed by John Harman <http://dstretch.com>), was used to adjust colour levels of images of motifs and areas where rock art was suspected, again, using both digitally rendered images and original field photography. The DStretch filters for all motifs that produced the best contrast results were recorded because understanding which DStretch RGB filters are most effective can assist in understanding the colours of the rock and any applied pigment including evidence of recursive practices, and can assist with determining the contrast state [@mcdonald, 923]. Hence, all filters were cycled through here and observed, with multiple examples often saved rather than just the most effective for illuminating particular details. All image data were logged to a central location and marked up with annotations to provide visual indication of the classification as it was being undertaken, and have been preserved.

The resulting imagery, together with the 3-D models were systematically reviewed to identify and classify individual motifs present at each shelter and panel. Several considerations were made in the development and application of a classificatory schema. Most notably, we sought to ensure broad comparability with previous work in the wider region to facilitate inter-regional analyses. Second, the classificatory approach was overtly formal and adopted an etic perspective to explore potential trends and patterns in motif production [@franklin2004, 28]. Therefore, the nomenclature used here does not denote the intended meaning(s) of motifs [@cole2011; @morphy1999]. Motifs were initially classified according to technique, initially selecting whether they were engravings or paintings, but later this was amended to include a third technique of engravings with applied pigment: infilled engravings (Appendix 1) [after @cole2006; @trezise1971, 128]. Specific techniques were also noted with the major categories of 'pecked', 'abraded' and 'incised' for engraved motifs, and 'outline', 'infilled', and 'stencil for paintings (Appendix 1). Where pigment was evident, colour designations were made visually and in line with level 1 colour 'centroids' outlined in the Inter-Society Color Council--National Bureau of Standards (ISCC-NBS) System of Color Designation, which identifies generic hues (e.g. 'Red' or 'Brown') as the first level of a universal colour classification scheme @kelly1976. This was sufficient in terms of the aims of this research and enabled us to 'bin' colour into unambiguous broad categories, thus avoiding subjective designations at more refined levels. Further classifications drawing on instrumental analyses such as surface pigment chemistry [@huntley2021] could also be worthwhile, particularly as knowledge of the regional assemblage grows. The contrast state (Appendix 2) of engraved motifs based on the visual 'freshness' of the engraving was also assessed visually, providing a general measure of weathering [@donaldson2011, 38-9].

The second tier of classification, motif category, assessed whether a motif was figurative, non-figurative or a track [after @brady2014]. Figurative motifs were defined as those depicting an object, person, animal, and so on, that is, where the subject is clearly identifiable from a researcher's perspective [@maynard1977]. Non-figurative motifs are those that may be more abstract in their design, where 'the uninformed observer cannot arrive at any helpful associations for naming the figure's [@maynard1977, 396], aside from the description of their basic form\[s\], while tracks refer to indications of markings left by the paws, feet, hands or other impressions from animals or humans. Southeast CYP rock art is renowned for its regionally and indeed sub-regionally varied assemblages of differing subject matter across all general techniques [@cole2016; @david1995]. Despite this, no standard schema exists for the wider region, at least in published form, though certainly there is extensive commentary and diverse approaches that have been adopted [see discussion in @cole1995; @cole2016; @david1995].

Here, and noting issues around whether to adopt a classificatory approach tending towards either 'lumping' or 'splitting' [@adams1988] we have sought to seek a balance by classifying at two levels. First, we sought to classify motifs according to general type and being consistent with most prior research, including categories of geometric, human, anthropomorphic, animal, tracks and zoomorphic motifs, regardless of technique; second, we also classified a specific type within each general type (see Appendix 3). In general, we avoided creating new classifications of specific motif type until such a time as the split was needed because the variability we observed was too important to ignore, such as in the difference between freshwater tortoise and marine turtle motifs. Despite this, disagreement on naming conventions of some motifs will persist and we note this has long been a theme in research in CYP [see @flood1987; @rosenfeld1981] and elsewhere [see @franklin2004, 30-32]. We also recognise this represents another example of etic arbitrary classification that may well be meaningless [@franklin2004, 28]. Nevertheless, here we adopt and make available a standardised schema for motif classification (Appendix 1-2) and which is essential given our etic approach.

There are, of course, limitations on these data. First, subjectivity in classifications of motif type is a major issue despite our etic approach, and we managed this through the collaboration of authors who conferred about the appropriate classification of each motif identified during the desktop analysis. Second, compared to southeast CYP, our sample size might be described as 'small'; still, we argue that meaningful insights on the research questions explored here can be generated and that will, in turn, underpin new research questions. The motifs presented here undoubtedly comprise a very small sample of the total record of rock art for the wider region, particularly given its complex geology (Figure 2); however, given the lack of archaeological research across the ranges of CYP north of Koolburra (Figure 1), these results provide insights on local place-marking practices and, as we argue below, much more.

Finally, to mitigate issues around bias and small sample size, we used use statistical tests to assess the relationship between motif general and specific type and site location. Using R, the dataset was subsetted into engraved and painted motifs, and we elected to omit infilled engravings due to very small numbers. A series of Pearson's Chi-Square tests were conducted on each subset for both general and specific types. Results indicated significant relationships with P-values (\< 0.05) between site and: a) Paintings, General Type ( 3.314e-12); Paintings, Specific Type (1.579e-07), and c) Engravings, Specific Type (0.02459). The relationship between site and Engravings, General Type, was insignificant (0.08934) and omitted from further statistical analysis here. A correspondence analysis (CA) was undertaken on each subset using the FactoMineR package (Lê et al. 2008) with contribution biplots (Greenacre 2013) used.to visualise and help interpret results.

Following the completion of an intial traditional research thesis [@marshall2018] using digital methods described above, it was necessary to reproduce and refine initial classifications in order to publish our results. While we had adhered to a relatively clear approach in the classification, the figures, tables and statistical analyses were not. Hence, at this time, Morrison re-analysed the original dataset and in doing so sought to adopt an explicit approach of reproducibility, including through use of a workflow built on both *R* [@base] and *Quarto*, an open source technical and writing system [@allaire2022]. The involved developing three extensive computational scripts to process, clean and present the original tabular data [after @marshall2018].

# Results

Three sites were investigated within two clan estates, Chuula 1 (CH01) and Chuula 2 (CH02), and Wa'tanchi 1 (WT01) (Figure 2). All three sites occur on sandstone escarpments within the upper Wenlock River Basin, on the uppermost portions of seasonal creeks, and set within *Eucalyptus*-dominant savannah woodland. Chuula 1 and 2 are positioned on the mid-slope of a low escarpment, a short distance from each other. Chuula 1 comprises a 30 m^2^ shelter beneath a large sandstone overhang, with a near-vertical exposed surface at the rear (Figure 3). Three art panels were recorded, and seventeen stone artefacts were noted on the shelter floor. Chuula 2 (CH02, Figure 3) is a smaller, 15 m^2^ overhang beneath an outcrop of sandstone downslope of Chuula 1. The shelter floor has a gentle slope running south-north, but this breaks abruptly at the outer drip line where a 20--45º scree slope occurs. The lower-most shelter wall is near-vertical, rising to form a distinct high recess 2--4 m above the shelter floor. Three distinct panels were identified on this site, the first within the upper recess and two others on adjacent vertical surfaces below.

Wa'tanchi 1 (WT01, Figure 3) occurs at the base of a sheer sandstone escarpment (Figure 3) and consists of a series of overhangs around a seasonal creek and waterfall that flows over the escarpment after rainfall. Vegetation around the site includes a local area of dry notophyll vine forest on the creek line, and this transitions to open sclerophyll woodland within a few hundred metres of the site. Five art panels were defined, and these included a wide range of engravings and pigment art both in figurative and geometric designs. Several quartz artefacts were observed on the shelter floor and in an exposed section beneath a large fallen boulder. A single piece of flaked and retouched opaque glass was also noted, illustrating colonial-era activity at the site.

## Overall trends

A total of 261 motifs were recorded, including 123 at WT01, 100 at CH02 and 38 at CH01. This included 199 paintings (76%), 52 engravings (20%) and 10 infilled engravings (4%) (Table 1). Non-figurative designs were the most frequent motif category regardless across all techniques comprising \~54% (n=141) of the total assemblage (Table 1). A further \~28% (n=72) were figurative, \~12% tracks (n=32), and the remainder (\~7%, n=17) were indeterminate (Table 1). Some 27% (n=70) of the entire assemblage were painted figurative designs, with very few figurative engravings (\<1%, n=2) and no figurative infilled engravings (Table 1).

Table 1: Suggested placement

Of the total 209 motifs with pigment evident, all were monochrome, and this included some 184 classified as brown (88%). Other motif colours were uncommon but included 23 that were red (11%) and 2 yellow ( 1%) (Table 2). Colour usage varies between sites and in relation to general technique. Motifs are primarily brown at CH02 (33%) and WT01 (53%), while those at CH01 are primarily red (10%) (Table 2). As noted, infilled engravings are rare, but recorded at CH01 (6) and CH02 (4); most (5) are red pigment, reflecting the predominance of this colour here (Table 2).

A limited range of techniques have been documented in the overall assemblage. The major technique observed was infilled painted motifs (n=136, 52%) followed by paintings as outlines (n=56, 22%) (Table 3). Drawings, hand stencils and other techniques of applying pigment were not evident. Regarding specific techniques of engraving, abraded and pecked motifs were equally represented (20 in each class, each 8% of the overall assemblage) with all instances of abraded motifs noted at CH02 (Table 3). Most infilled engravings were abraded (5) with one instance of a pecked motif and one in outline, with pigment placed around the margin of the engraving (Table 3). Documentation of the contrast state of engravings indicated that some 85% had moderate to heavy weathering (contrast states 1--3) with the remainder having a generally 'fresher' appearance (Table 4). One contact engraving at CH01, the European lettering 'RTK', fell into this latter grouping with a very fresh appearance in contrast to deeply incised engravings near the panel floor at WT01, where engravings were all classed as heavily weathered (contrast state 1) (Table 4).

Table 2: Suggested placement

Table 3: Suggested placement

Table 4: Suggested placement

Exploration of motif types within each of the general technique categories (Table 5, Figure 4) provides finer-grained insights into local variability than is revealed in the high-level data on motif category alone (Table 1). For the total assemblage, painted geometric motifs are the most common general type at \~37% (n=96). Other general types of painted motifs found in modest proportions included human figures (\~11%, n=29), animal designs (6.5%, n=17), tracks (6.5%, n=17) and small numbers of anthropomorphic (\~3%, n=9) or zoomorphic motifs (\<1%, n=2) (Table 5). There is low diversity in general types of engraved and infilled engravings, with geometric motifs with this technique comprising some 17% (n=45) of the overall dataset. Across all general techniques of motif creation then, geometric designs are most frequently occurring general type of motif (Table 5, Figure 4).

Table 5: Suggested placement

Figure 4: Suggested placement

## Site-specific trends

The CH01 site has the smallest number of motifs of the three places we investigated, with 38 recorded comprising 15% of the total assemblage (Table 1). These include 18 paintings, 14 engravings and 6 infilled engravings; non-figurative motifs were the most common category across all general techniques (Table 1). Red was the predominant colour used in paintings and infilled engravings (Table 2), and contrast state recorded for engravings were in the range 2-3, with clear colour differences in relation to the adjoining rock surface and thus indicative of modest to significant weathering (Table 4, Appendix 2). Most engravings and infilled engravings were geometric (Figure 5), with three engraved tracks noted (Table 5).

Within the assemblage of painted motifs at CH01, geometric forms were the most common general type of painting (Table 5, Figure 4). Only one figurative motif was depicted, an animal form classified as a lizard. The CA highlighted a dependent relationship with tracks at the level of general type (Figure 5). Thus, overall, motifs at CH01 evidence a clear preference across all techniques towards the depiction of geometric motifs and tracks are represented in significant numbers here compared with other sites studied. A clear preference towards use of red is also evident where pigment is used.

The CH02 site is visually impressive when approached, with a 2-4 m high natural recess forming a wide concave panel with a series of distinct figurative paintings, mostly animals or zoomorphic features (Figure 3). Two other panels were defined beneath this, which were near-vertical and running to the shelter floor. These preserve assemblages of densely spaced engraved and painted motifs of varying sizes, indicating a history of intensive use and frequent superpositioning. Some 100 motifs were recorded here (Table 1), mostly painted (69) and the remainder engraved (31). Engraved forms were primarily geometric designs (15) and tracks (10), with one example of European lettering, 'R.K.A.', the only obvious colonial-era motif in the entire assemblage (Figure 6). This is superimposed over several infilled figurative motifs. One of the more prominent geometric engravings is a radiating line resembling a star at the end of a long, meandering engraved line (Figure 6-A). The outline helps distinguish the motif from the somewhat weathered surface.

Of sixty-nine paintings and four infilled engravings recorded at CH02, most (n=69) were brown (Table 2). Furthermore, most paintings were figurative designs, with some 50 recorded, together with a smaller number of non-figurative (13) and track motifs (4) (Table 1). The CA indicated a strong dependent relationship between these sites and general motif types, including 'Human', 'Animal' and 'Zoomorph' motifs (Figure 5). This is further indicated in the CA for specific motif types, with statistically significant relationships between CH02 and motifs classified as humans, males, or marine turtles (Figure 7). A range of rarer figurative subjects, such as macropods (1), lizards (3), freshwater tortoises (2), anthropomorphic subjects (2), and a single dog, were also noted (Table 5, Appendix 4). Thirteen geometric paintings were identified, and these included complex lines, crescents, and stacked circles, though the CA (Figure 7) does not indicate a statistically significant relationship here meaning these are a more widespread category within motifs recorded across the three sites investigated here.

The site features a range of prominent, highly visible motifs that are relatively large and in the range of 40-90 cm in diameter. Most notable were five animals classified as marine turtles and a further two long-necked tortoises (Figure 6), which reflects the specific ways in which varied species from quite different ecological contexts are depicted locally. Few turtles or tortoises are shown outside of this site. Individual detail indicates some variation in the depiction of marine turtles, including lines near the head and mouth --- possibly indicating movement or action --- as well as some use of infilling via the linear application of pigment on interior portions (Figure 6).

Some 138 motifs were identified at WT01, most were paintings (\~112), with a few engravings (11) and no infilled engravings (Table 4). All the engraved motifs at this site occurred on the same portion of Panel 4, near the shelter floor (Figure 6). Engraved motifs were exclusively classified as geometric in terms of general type, and included complex lines, crescents, and several examples of pits. One striking engraving on a near-horizontal panel near the shelter floor is a deeply engraved and heavily weathered grouping of complex lines, crescents and pits, with a contrast state of 1 (Table 4). Some 112 painted motifs were recorded at WT01, including 73 non-figurative motifs (n=73), 18 figurative motifs and 10 tracks (Table 1). A near-exclusive use of brown pigment is evident, with one example of use of red (Table 2). In terms of motif general type, 73 were classified as geometric, and when further classified in terms of specific type, complex lines (n=19) and line series (n=19) were the most frequent specific types (Appendix 4). The CA indicated a strong relationship with geometric forms in terms of general type (Figure 5), while analysis of specific type revealed a strong association with a large number of motifs, including stars, circles, dots, and stacked or complex lines, which are rare or absent elsewhere (Figure 7). A range of other rarer geometric forms were also noted, including the four 'complex geometric' motifs comprised of a combination of irregular lines and dots in what appears as a single painting event (Figure 6) -- but not noted at other sites. A further unique and striking motif at Wa'tanchi, located on the same panel, is the presence of a horizontally depicted human, which, unlike other human figures at Chuula 2, had a series of short lines depicted through the abdomen area and comprises a heavy application of dark, heavily applied red pigment (Figure 6). This was the only human motif at the site. Animals were infrequently depicted, but one example of what we classified as a marine stingray comprised a rounded and roughly diamond-shaped body with a thin, elongated tail curving back towards the body (Figure 6-E).

# Discussion

The Kuuku I'yu rock art record represents a palimpsest of long-term histories of place marking, reflecting the accrual and loss of motifs as well as potential hiatuses and variability in place use and rock art production through time. There is clear evidence for the loss of portions of motifs and panels, as well as extensive evidence for deterioration of the art via exposure and weathering, water flow and animal rubbing. Effectively, these are time-averaged assemblages, and as is the case with other such deposits in archaeological settings, a lack of or poor chronological control does not negate the potential to address appropriate research questions. We argue that these assemblages provide insights into local histories of place use, arguably reflecting culturally significant thematic concerns through time, as well as local variability and likely cultural dynamism through time. The challenge for work on Kuuku I'yu *Ngaachi* is that we have no sense of the time-depth of motifs or occupation of associated rock art sites, nor indeed, of any Indigenous heritage site within the wider northern Great Dividing Range region---due to a virtual lack of research north of Coen, away from coastal settings. Hence, our working assumption is that, like southeastern CYP [@cole2016; @cole1995; @david2002], Kuuku I'yu painted motifs are likely skewed in age towards the late-Holocene, while engravings potentially have much longer time depth [@watchman1993]; both assertions require further evaluation in the Kuuku I'yu context. Here we outline the results of our study and present broad interpretations, in part, to guide further debate and research.

Our formal analysis reveals a heterogeneous regional assemblage, with variation between sites in both frequencies and proportions of motifs across major classificatory groupings. Chuula 1, the smallest assemblage, is characterised by predominantly non-figurative and track motifs across all techniques, with only two figurative motifs observed. Where pigment was used, it was mostly red. Infilled engravings were uncommon across all sites, but were most abundant at CH01, and this site featured mostly geometric designs. The nearby site CH02 has the highest frequency of painted figurative motifs of the three shelters investigated thus far. The pigment used here was almost exclusively brown across both paintings and a small number of infilled engravings. This site also had the largest number of engravings noted at any location we have investigated, and these are mostly geometric or track designs. Despite CH02 having the most frequent engraved and painted motifs, the WT01 shelter preserves the largest number of motifs of any site in the study area recorded thus far, with 47% of all motifs occurring here (Table 1). This place's motif assemblage comprised mostly paintings, no infilled engravings, and the smallest number of engravings of any of the three sites. In contrast to CH02, WT01 motifs are primarily non-figurative geometric or track motifs, with a strong and near-exclusive use of brown pigment.

Exploration of spatial trends drew on statistical tests of the relationship between site, and both general and specific motif types for engraved and painted motifs. Chi-square tests indicated no dependent relationship between general or specific types of engravings and site, likely reflecting the small subset of motif data available for this class (Table 4); due to this, engravings were not explored via CA. In contrast, paintings comprise some 76% of all recorded motifs (Table 4), with considerable variation in terms of colour, category and both general/specific motif types. Furthermore, statistically significant relationships exist for painted motifs at the level of both general and specific types. This affords insight into the distribution of particular motif categories. Of particular note was that at the level of general type, CH02 clearly has a strong dependent relationship with motifs categorised as human or animal, while WT01 had a very different assemblage, evidenced in this place's strong relationship with the depiction of painted geometric designs at the level of general type. Noting CH01 had the smallest number of paintings, a weak but significant relationship exists in terms of the occurance of painted tracks.

All three of the places we have studied occur in the same ecological context of open savannah woodland, near localised patches of dry mesophyll vine forest, with ephemeral streams nearby. Given this relative homogeneity, the ecological setting alone is unlikely to be a major driver in variability in motifs at each site. In contrast, however, the physical characteristics of each shelter vary substantially, and elsewhere, this has been shown to be important in the analysis of rock art assemblages (Cole 2016; McDonald 2008). Of the two known art sites within the Chuula clan estate, CH02 is closest to a seasonal creek and situated on a narrow open terrace, sheltered within the upper recess of a deep gully, and the art is locally very prominent, with many figurative motifs visible from a distance. Motif authors at CH02 frequently depicted animals and humans in figurative designs in typically medium to large format motifs. In contrast, the upper-most shelter, CH01, is difficult to access due to its position at the top of a steep and boulder-strewn slope. Despite having a larger floor area than CH02, and being comparably better suited to occupation, this shelter has the lowest number of motifs, which are mostly small, inconspicuous, and feature a near-exclusive use of red pigment with a strong preference towards more abstract geometric and track designs, particularly engravings. The third shelter, Wa'tanchi 1, is an accessible and open shelter complex located at the head of a small seasonal creek, complete with a seasonal waterfall. This place features a near-level floor with a wide area sheltered from the weather. It is also the largest of the two Chuula sites in terms of floor area, with several vertical panels. There is a greater tendency towards painted geometric designs, often smaller and inconspicuous and with rarer figurative motifs of animals or humans.

In summary, this study reveals considerable variability in rock art across the three sites investigated here. Motif variability is statistically significant in terms of the distribution of figurative paintings, with strong trends towards humans and animals at CH02 and geometric and track motifs at WT01. The assemblages of motifs at WT01 and CH02 are potentially larger, in part because they are more physically accessible localities and thus reflect histories of more intensive place marking and possibly occupation histories, though this is an assertion that needs to be evaluated through further research, including excavations. In contrast, CH01 is more physically restricted, and despite this shelter's suitability as a medium for both occupation and for the creation and preservation of rock art, the assemblage here is associated with the use of almost exclusive geometric or track motifs (all techniques) and a preference towards the use of red pigments. Potentially, this reflects activities associated with place marking associated with specific or restricted activities for social, cultural, gender or other reasons.

# Conclusion

This study set out to describe and analyse rock art assemblages within the homelands of Kuuku I'yu Pama to understand local rock art traditions. Our broader goal was to explore what these assemblages reveal about local and regional histories of social interaction and the links between personhood, social interaction and rock art. With less than 300 motifs documented within a vast area of upland sandstone ranges that have not been investigated, there is an acute need for further research regionally, but despite this, our study at least begins to address a longstanding gap in knowledge regarding the histories of Kuuku I'yu and other local Pama in the northern CYP ranges.
